> Encoding Utilities for TypeScript

Assuming you have NPM, TSD installed run the following:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
jspm install
```

```bash
tsd reinstall
```

For development run:

```bash
node_modules/.bin/karma start
```

This will compile and run the tests each time you make a change.
